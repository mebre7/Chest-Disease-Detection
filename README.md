# NeuroVision: Automated Brain Tumor MRI Classification

An end-to-end production-grade computer vision system designed to classify brain MRI scans into four distinct categories: **Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor**. This project emphasizes modular software engineering, clean configuration-driven architecture, and robust deployment workflows.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Modular Pipeline Architecture:** Separated components for data ingestion, validation, model training, and evaluation.
* **Transfer Learning Backbone:** Utilizes pre-trained convolutional neural networks optimized for high-accuracy medical image classification.
* **Configuration-Driven:** Centralized parameter management via YAML configuration files.
* **REST API Integration:** Built-in utilities for handling base64-encoded image payloads for seamless web and client application integration.
